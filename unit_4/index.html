	<p>My spark for graphic design took off in 2015 when I came across a couple of Tumblr images. After doing my research, I was brought upon Photoshop CC, probably the best image-editing software out there. Also, my favorite program to be on. Rose's Graphic Design is an online business that intends to do the following: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Custom designs for your websites, businesses, etc.</li>
		<li>Low prices.</li>
		<li>The higest quality design because your satisfaction matters.</li>
	</ul>
